# Unreal Cpp Auto Import

Used to help imports of C++ header files.

Warning: This "AutoBackgroundMain.py" script does contain a key-press-logger. However, it is used to find what module you are looking for. The app itself will not track or log anything to the disk or transmit it over the network. If you are not comfortable with this, only run "ManualMain.py", this version you would have to manually paste in the content to look up.
